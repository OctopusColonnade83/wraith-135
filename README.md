## Why we built it

Over the course of our work at **Arcanum**, we kept reaching for two different
kinds of tooling and wishing they were one thing.

On one side was **BeEF** — the Browser Exploitation Framework — for the classic
*hook a browser, then work from inside its session* workflow: keylog a fake login,
recon the local network, push a module at a live victim. It's the tool we used to
make man-in-the-browser real to people. But it's showing its age, big chunks of it
are unreliable in today's browsers, and the social-engineering overlays look like
logins from a decade ago.

On the other side were our favorite **blind-XSS callback frameworks** (XSS Hunter,
ezXSS): drop a payload into a field, and the instant it fires somewhere you can't
see, it calls home with the loot — origin, cookies, DOM, a screenshot.

What we increasingly needed — especially as more of our targets became **AI
application ecosystems**, where untrusted text flows through agents, tool outputs,
admin review queues, and support consoles, and *fires JavaScript in places nobody
is watching* — was a single framework that did **both**: the interactive,
persistent post-exploitation control of a BeEF hook, **and** the fire-and-forget
blind-XSS callback loot, in one payload that's reliable in current browsers and
looks like today's real login screens.

So we built **WRAITH**.

## Heads up: this is a work in progress

We're releasing WRAITH **early, and on purpose.** We'd rather get it into the
hands of the people who'll actually use it — and hear what breaks — than sit on it
until it's "done."

That means: **expect rough edges and bugs.** Some modules are more battle-tested
than others, browser behavior shifts under us constantly (see the network-scan
notes below), and APIs may change between versions. If you hit something, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/OctopusColonnade83/wraith-135/issues) — repro steps,
browser + version, and what you expected are gold. PRs welcome under the project's
[contribution terms](#license--attribution).

## Features

### Hook + operator console

`/hook.js` is a small payload. Drop it in any page you control
(`<script src="/hook.js"></script>`) or deliver it via an XSS in your target. The
browser that loads it opens a WebSocket back to the operator, fingerprints itself
(browser, OS, IP, page, UA), auto-reconnects, and survives navigation. Every
hooked browser shows up live in the console, where you pick one and drive it — the
full dashboard is the hero shot at the top of this README: hooked-browser roster,
target detail, deploy controls, live activity feed, and captured credentials.

### Social-engineering overlays

Modernized fake-login overlays, rendered in an **isolated shadow DOM** so they
look pixel-correct on any host page and frost-blur the page behind them like a
real re-auth modal. Ships with **LinkedIn**, **Facebook**, and **Microsoft /
Office 365** (authentic two-step email → password).

### Live keystrokes + captured credentials

Every character the target types into an overlay streams to the console in real
time, and the submitted credentials land in **Captured Credentials** — all
persisted so nothing is lost on refresh or restart.

### Page Capture — the blind-XSS loot

The instant a browser hooks, WRAITH auto-fires **Page Capture**: exactly what a
blind-XSS framework grabs when your payload fires somewhere you can't see —
**where** it fired (origin + URL + referrer), the victim's **cookies**
(non-HttpOnly), the full **DOM**, and a **screenshot**. Failures are reported
honestly, because they *are* the lesson: HttpOnly cookies never appear, and CSP or
cross-origin canvas tainting can block the screenshot.

![Page Capture blind-XSS loot](docs/screenshots/page-capture.png)

### Page Mirror — go beyond the screenshot 🆕

**This is where WRAITH goes further than the tools it replaces.** When you land a
blind XSS or a hook in a page, most frameworks stop at a **screenshot and a dump
of raw HTML** — you can see *where* your payload fired, but you can't actually *do*
anything with it.

WRAITH's **Page Mirror** turns that dead-end loot into a **live, navigable view of
the application**. Open the hooked page as a real, rendered browser view inside the
like the victim would.

![Page Mirror — a live, clickable view of the hooked page](docs/screenshots/page-mirror.png)

The key: **every navigation is fetched *through the hooked browser***, so it rides
the victim's session and same-origin trust. Any page, endpoint, or feature the
victim's session can reach, **you can reach too** — including pages gated behind an
authenticated session cookie you never see (and, being HttpOnly, could never steal
outright).

In the example below, we start on a support-agent's ticket queue and click
straight through to an internal **Credential Vault** — a page that only resolves
inside an authenticated agent session. No credentials phished, no cookie stolen:
we simply rode the victim's session to it.

> Cross-origin reads still fail by design (the Same-Origin Policy holds) — the
> mirror's reach is exactly the victim's reach, no more, no less. That boundary is
> itself part of the lesson.

### Blind-XSS payload catalog

An XSS-Hunter-style catalog of ready-to-fire injection strings for every context
(HTML, attribute breakout, tag-close, event handlers, JS context, `javascript:`
URIs, jQuery), each auto-filled with **your** hook URL and one-click copyable.

![Blind-XSS payload catalog](docs/screenshots/payload-catalog.png)

### Local / localhost network scan

Uses the hooked browser as a proxy to fingerprint the victim's **local** services.
It's a **timing side-channel**, rebuilt for current browsers — the reliable default
is a *calibrated* `127.0.0.1` scan using **two independent primitives** (fetch- and
WebSocket-timing, the literal eBay `check.js` method). LAN modes are included but
honestly labeled, because Chrome 142+ Local Network Access now gates them (see
[below](#about-the-network-scan-read-before-you-demo-it)).

### Built-in practice lab

A deliberately vulnerable "support desk" at `/lab` with a stored-XSS sink, so you
can demo the whole chain end to end, same-origin: submit a malicious ticket → an
"agent" reviews the queue and the payload fires (the blind-XSS moment) → Page
Mirror the hooked agent and pull the session-gated vault. Intentionally insecure by
design, with planted flags.

## Teaching blind XSS on this platform

The hook fires the moment it loads, exactly like a blind-XSS payload dropped into a
stored field that later renders in some admin/support/log/agent context you can't
see. Lessons surfaced right in the data:

- **Cookies are JS-readable only.** HttpOnly cookies never appear, which is the
  whole point of HttpOnly — and exactly why Page Mirror's *ride the session*
  approach matters more than *steal the cookie*.
- **Screenshots are best-effort.** html2canvas can be blocked by **CSP**, and
  **cross-origin images taint the canvas** so it can't be exported. Those failures
  are reported honestly instead of hidden.
- **Origin + referrer tell you where you landed**, which for blind XSS is the
  entire question ("where did my payload execute?").

For an offline lab, self-host html2canvas — see `public/vendor/README.md`.

## About the network scan (read before you demo it)

JavaScript cannot read cross-origin responses, but it can start a request and watch
how it fails and how fast, which leaks port state. The module was rebuilt around
what works in **current browsers (2025–2026)**, because the old BeEF-era LAN sweep
is now dead.

**The modern reality:** Chrome 142+ (Oct 2025) shipped **Local Network Access
(LNA)**, which gates requests to private ranges (10.x / 172.16.x / **192.168.x**)
behind a permission prompt. A blind LAN sweep no longer reaches the wire. But
**loopback (127.0.0.1) is still reachable**, and scanning it is the real-world
attack — eBay, Best Buy, and others were caught port-scanning visitors' localhost
to fingerprint local services and remote-access tools.

So the module has three modes:

- **This machine (localhost)** — the **reliable default**. A *calibrated*
  `127.0.0.1` scan that probes each port with fetch-timing **and** WebSocket-timing,
  learns this machine's RST baseline first, then flags anything that resolves,
  hangs, or runs slower as **OPEN**, labels the likely service, and shows whether
  **fetch**, **ws**, or **both** agreed. Works in Chrome **and** Firefox today.
- **LAN host** — scan one private IP. Works only if the browser lets it through;
  Chrome 142+ will usually block it (the module detects this and says so).
- **Discover LAN hosts** — subnet sweep. Mostly LNA-blocked now; kept to *show* the
  block as the lesson.

## How it maps to BeEF (for the lecture)

| BeEF | WRAITH |
|---|---|
| `hook.js` + XHR polling | `public/hook.js` + WebSocket (live, reliable) |
| Ruby server + RESTful API | `server.js` (Node + `ws`) |
| Online/offline browsers panel | Operator console "Hooked Browsers" |
| Pretty Theft module | overlay `modules/*.js` (modern LinkedIn/Facebook/Microsoft) |
| Network discovery / port scanner | `modules/portscan.js` (calibrated, current-browser) |
| Command results | Live keystrokes + Captured Credentials + Scan Results |
| *(no equivalent)* | **Page Capture** (blind-XSS loot) + **Page Mirror** (navigate the app) |

## "How is this different from blind XSS, Evilginx, or EvilGoPhish?"

These tools live at **different stages of the attack** and abuse **different trust
contexts**. They're complementary, and they chain together.

| | WRAITH / BeEF | Blind-XSS frameworks (XSS Hunter, ezXSS) | AiTM proxies (Evilginx, EvilGoPhish, Modlishka) |
|---|---|---|---|
| What it is | Man-in-the-browser **post-exploitation** C2 (+ blind-XSS loot) | XSS **detection + proof** with one-shot recon | **Adversary-in-the-middle** reverse proxy |
| Prerequisite | You already have **JS running in the page** | Same: your payload executes somewhere you can't see | Victim **clicks a link and logs in** on your lookalike domain |
| Origin it abuses | The victim's **real session / real origin** | The vulnerable app's origin | A **separate attacker domain** proxying the real site |
| What you capture | Creds + keystrokes + recon + blind-XSS loot **+ navigate the app via Page Mirror** | "It fired, and here": DOM, cookies, screenshot, origin | Real creds **and the post-MFA session token** |
| Beats MFA? | **No** — you phished a static credential | Only if it rides a live authed session in-page | **Yes** — stealing the post-auth session cookie is the point |

The honest distinction to teach: our overlay phish harvests **what the user
types** — it does **not** capture a real session or beat MFA. That's exactly why
it's a great contrast, and why the industry moved to **phishing-resistant,
origin-bound auth (FIDO2 / WebAuthn / passkeys)**. A realistic kill chain uses all
three: blind XSS finds and delivers code execution, a WRAITH hook gives interactive
in-session control (and, via Page Mirror, reaches app functionality directly), and
a redirect can funnel the victim into an Evilginx flow for a real MFA-passed
session.

## Configuration

Everything is env-driven; the same build runs anywhere because `hook.js` derives
its call-back URL from wherever it was served. `setup.sh` writes these into `.env`.

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `WRAITH_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | bind interface (`0.0.0.0` to expose; forced in Docker) |
| `WRAITH_PORT` | `3000` | HTTP + WebSocket port (`setup.sh` defaults to `8090`) |
| `WRAITH_PUBLIC_URL` | *(derived)* | your IP/domain, used to print correct hook URLs |
| `WRAITH_OP_USER` | *(empty)* | operator login username (optional; `setup.sh` sets one) |
| `WRAITH_OP_PASSWORD` | *(empty)* | operator login password; **required** to bind publicly |
| `WRAITH_SECRET` | *(random/boot)* | signs session cookies; set it to keep logins across restarts |
| `WRAITH_SESSION_HOURS` | `12` | operator session lifetime |
| `WRAITH_AUTOCAPTURE` | `1` | auto-fire Page Capture on hook (`0` = manual, BeEF-style) |

A signed HttpOnly session cookie covers both the panel and the live WebSocket. The
hook payload, demo page, and `/ws/hook` channel stay public so victims can reach
them. As a fail-safe, the server **refuses to bind to a public interface** unless a
password is set.
